      <p>Diwali is my favourite festival. It is the festival of lights; it is celebrated in all parts of our country. A few days before Diwali, people clean their houses and shops and get them whitewashed. On Diwali day, people decorate their houses. On the night of Diwali, lamps are lit in every village, town and city. All the houses, shops and buildings are illuminated with earthen lamps, candles and electric bulbs. Children move about in their best clothes. People exchange sweets and gifts. Children spend money in buying sweets, toys and crackers. At night people worship ‘Laxmi’, the goddess of wealth. Diwali is a festival of joy. On this day everyone is happy.</p>

      <p>Diwali or popularly known Deepavali is one of the widely celebrated festivals in India. It gets its name from a ‘row of diyas’ in Hindi. Diwali falls in October and November, on the 15th day of the Karthik month. The festival celebrates to rejoice Lord Rama’s return to Ayodhya after 14 years, upon being victorious against Ravana. The celebrations are divided in three days, starting from Dhanteras, when people buy gold and utensils for the household. Followed by this is Choti Diwali, which marks the beginning of all festivities of Diwali. The day of Diwali is rather hectic and filled with various activities. People make rangoli, Worship Goddess Laxmi, and clean the house thoroughly. </p>

    </h3>
      <p>
       Firstly, Though Diwali is a great Hindu Festival. But during this COVID 19 Period we must take all the necessary precautions and must follow the government guidlines given before.

        We must carry hand sanitizer with us.
        We also must maintain the social distance as per given by the government guidlines. <br>
        Secondly,

      <h3>
           Conclusion
      </h3>
      <p>
        The core idea behind Diwali is the understanding that Good will always prevail over evil. Different communities have their own folk lore’s and celebrate Diwali differently, but the principle remains intact. Diwali at the end is a festival that brings everyone joy and allows going back to people and bury hatchets. It embodies the lifting of spiritual darkness from our lives. Public offices are closed, and everyone is on leave.
        Enlighten your house with earthen pots, diyas and use natural fresh flowers for decoration.
